# Iterator Pattern Introduction

## Overview

The Iterator Pattern is a design pattern that allows sequential access to elements of an aggregate object without exposing its underlying representation. It falls under the behavioral pattern category, as it's used to manage algorithms, relationships, and responsibilities between objects.

The main idea behind the Iterator Pattern is to provide a way to access the elements of a collection object in a sequential manner without needing to know the internal details of the object. This pattern decouples the collection from the traversal logic.

## Components

The Iterator Pattern typically involves two key components:

- **Iterator**: An interface that defines the operations required for traversing a collection, such as `next()`, `hasNext()`, and `remove()`. The iterator object is responsible for maintaining the current position during traversal.

- **Aggregate**: An interface that defines the operation for creating an iterator object compatible with the collection. The aggregate object implements this interface and returns an instance of the corresponding iterator.

## Benefits

- **Simplifies the Collection API**: By separating the traversal mechanism from the collection, the collection API remains clean and simple.

- **Supports Different Traversal Strategies**: Different iterators can be provided for different traversal strategies on the same collection.

- **Encapsulates Traversal Logic**: Clients can traverse collection elements without understanding the internal structure of the collection.

## Applying the Iterator Pattern in JavaScript

JavaScript natively supports the Iterator Pattern through the Iterable and Iterator protocols. Many built-in data structures like Arrays, Maps, and Sets are iterable.

In our example application, we'll demonstrate how to implement and use the Iterator Pattern in JavaScript to traverse a custom collection. We'll focus on creating an iterable collection and accessing its elements using the iterator.

This approach showcases the pattern's utility in organizing data access in a controlled, sequential manner, which is especially beneficial in complex applications where different parts of the system need to iterate over shared data structures independently.

## Overview

The Image Directory Scanner is a Node.js script designed to recursively navigate through a specified directory (and its subdirectories), identifying and cataloging image files. It generates a structured JSON output that maps each folder to its contained image files, making it particularly useful for generating dynamic content for web pages or for inventory management purposes.

## Features

- **Recursive Directory Traversal**: Scans the specified directory and all its subdirectories for image files.
- **Supports Multiple Image Formats**: Recognizes a variety of image formats including PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WEBP, SVG, HEIF, and HEIC.
- **JSON Output**: Produces a JSON representation of the directory structure and the image files contained within, perfect for use in web applications or for further processing.
- **Command-line Interface**: Easily specify the directory to scan directly from the command line.

## Prerequisites

To use the Image Directory Scanner, ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system. The script relies on the `fs` and `path` modules available in Node.js for file system operations and path manipulations, respectively.

## Usage

1. **Save the Script**: Copy the provided script into a file, for example, `imageScanner.js`.
2. **Run the Script**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where `imageScanner.js` is saved, and run the script using Node.js by specifying the target directory as a command-line argument. Here's the syntax:

```sh
node imageScanner.js "/path/to/target/directory"
